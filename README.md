iTunesConnectReports-Extension
==============================

A very simple Today View extension for iOS 8 to check if today's iTunes Connect reports are already released.
I didn't find a nice API to check this. I checked the <a href="http://www.appfigures.com/itcstatus">appfigures.com/itcstatus</a> and I saw that in the source code they have a "haveTodays" value that indicates if the today's reports are released or not. I scraped the HTML code and display the value. Very simple.
I've added the default iTunes Connect app icon too.
